## 🌟Key Classes:
- **Shape.java:** Abstract class defining common properties and methods for 2D and 3D shapes.
- **TwoDShape.java:** Class for handling 2D shapes like Circle and Rectangle.
- **ThreeDShape.java:** Class for handling 3D shapes like Cylinder.
- **Circle.java:** Represents a circle with properties like radius and methods to calculate area.
- **Cylinder.java:** Represents a cylinder, extending 3DShape, with methods to calculate volume.
- **Rectangle.java:** Represents a rectangle with properties like length, width, and methods to calculate area.
- **Square.java:** Represents a square, a special case of a rectangle.
- **Game.java:** Main class that runs the game, providing a user interface to interact with the shapes.
- **User.java:** Represents the user of the game, allowing for interaction and selection of shapes.
## 🌟Features
